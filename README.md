# HW5-DayPlanner
----About----

    This application was designed to help a person plan out activities for each hour of the day. The current date and time are displayed at the top of the page. The user can refresh the page using the "Current Time" button. If the user prefers military time over standard time, they can click on "Current Time--..." to change the layout. The page visually changes color for each hour that has passed (grey), will come to pass (blue), and the current hour (red). Each row contains the time of the block, an input that allows users to enter in tasks they want to complete, and two buttons. The first button (floppy disk) saves the text in the input to local storage. The second button (x in a box) clears the line as well as the local storage corresponding to that line.

----Things To Add----

    This section is less formal. These are all of the features that I'd like to add if I have the time:

        Submit functionality on the form
        Time block display
        Hover over button changes cursor
        Hover over button for a couple seconds and it tells you what the button does
        Hover and changes view of item
        The buttons are not flush when they wrap
        Append button
        Collapse past time blocks
        List to show what has been added

----Technologies Used----

    HTML/CSS
        I used bootstrap to layout a grid, blocks, and general aesthetic.
        I used 2 icons from font-awesome (floppy and x in box).
        I used google fonts to get the font on the page.
    JavaScript/jQuery
        I used jQuery to traverse the DOM and target different elements of the page.
        I used jQuery to create my various events.
        I used jQuery to create my functions.
    moment.js
        I used moment.js to get the current time and date.
